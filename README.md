Advent of code from 2022 

### Get input for specific day

1. Look for `get_input.sh` script or just close this repo
2. Add execute permission `chmod +x ./get_input.sh`
3. Execute the script and provide a day as first param `./get_input.sh 1`
4. Script will ask for a session value which you'll find in the cookies on [advent of code](adventofcode.com) website
5. Input will be save to `1.in` where number correspond to day you provided
6. Session will be stored in hidden file `.session_cookie` for later use
